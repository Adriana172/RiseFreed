Questions:

What is RiseFreed?
RiseFreed is a website that helps domestic violence victims access legal services more efficiently.
Most domestic violence victims don't have access to legal services which are crucial to helping them
securing their freedom and safety. Our website was built in response to that in hopes of helping
pro bono domestic violence lawyers reach more victims and work through the process of filing 
restraing orders more effectively. Our website automates the process of collecting the information
for all the restraining order legal forms.

Where are the images on your site from?
All images from our project are from the royalty-free photographs on Unsplash (https://unsplash.com/).

How did you learn the process of filing 209A?
The research for the process of filing a 209A was completed with guidance from law students and Harvard Legal Aid Bureau pro bono lawyers with the support of the Harvard Access to Justice project.
Of note: there are a couple more questions for the 209A form that we want to integrate after the project is completed.

What happens to the answers right now after you submit them?
Because we wanted to focus on learning react and building out the site, our site is currently 
front-end and front-facing only. We are planning on implementing a back-end with an api
to send the results directly to pro bono domestic violence lawyers or to generate the pdf texts. We'd greatly appreciate any advice on how and where to start learning about backend!

For design:
    Sketch 2
We first made on-paper mock-ups, then drew them out in sketch, and began to code them. 
Some of the CSS styling was created with the support of pagedraw.io (refer to the CS50 seminar from 2017).

Many thanks for CS50 TFs Sela and Ethan Zhou, and friends Hossam Mabed and Tyler Hou for their advice on learning and coding react.
