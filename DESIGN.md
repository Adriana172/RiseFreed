A big part of the projec's design was made with page draw, which helped us focus on the actual implementation more. Every page has its own js folder, which has an index.j and a styles.js. Most of the styling for the particular page is defined in the styles.js and some of it is defined in the actual index.js before defining the render page. 

We aimed for the page to have a design that reflects the overall message of the impact of the app: familty harmony and peace. Therefore, we have decorated the pages with many background images promotig harmony and well being, so it can be user friendly and also incentivize a sense of trust in the user. 

The skeletons of the styles.js files are similar. Most of them have style features defined under desktop-0-0-0-X-X-X-X codes, in a numerical order of the components that we wanted to style. 

The design can be improved, and our ultimate goal is to have floating forms of the type of TYPEFORM and also have a backend secured so that we can autopopulate this forms and ultimately let the user print automatically a hard copy of them. This would require a lot of knowledge of design, because legal forms have specific formats.

We initially had a general form creator function, that would create all the forms using dictionaries of the questions. But, we notice that although it is superior design-wise, it is not very scalable because legal forms are very different and have totally different formats.
